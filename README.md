# HTC_GNN

## Introduction
* Source code for the paper "**Bi-directional** **prediction of hydrothermal carbonization characteristics of agroforestry and livestock wastes with variable components: Graph learning** **model-aided waste recycle**".

* We design a multi-components graph of Hydrochar, enabling HTC_GNN model to extract vital chemical information from  hydrothermal carbonization reactions. With a carefully designed hydrochar graph, HTC_GNN can learn more chemical information from hydrothermal carbonization reaction information. 


## Environment

* base dependencies:
```
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - python>=3.10.0
  - pytorch>=2.0.1
  - Pytorch-geometric>=2.3.1
```
